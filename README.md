# Overview

In this software project, I was introducing myself to c++. This is a sample banking system software that was used to learn the basics of the language including: variables, functions, classes, loops, and data structures.

This banking software allows a user to create an account and sign in. Once they have successfully completed that step, they are then directed to a menu:
1) view their account info 
2) view their balance
3) deposit funds
4) withdraw funds 
5) quit the program

The purpose of this software was to learn and familiarize myself with the language while also creating something that may be useful in future projects or careers. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I used the IDE of Visual Studio Community to write the software with the version control system of Git and Github.

I used C++ in this project.
